The notebook has everything. It is super easy to follow. You just find the tab corresponding to the part you want to find the code for, then go to the "dataset" section or the "convent" section for networks, etc for training, testing, etc. The one note on special libraries is that I used Albumentations for easy image augmentations that would update the keypoints, imported as variable name "A" but it acts identically to torchvision.transforms really.
